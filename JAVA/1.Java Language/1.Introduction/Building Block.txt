1. Compiler
Compilers are static translators. They usually translate a high level language to machine language.  
C C++ Programs are typically not executed directly in the Runtime Environment
The Source has to be translated into machine language 
Compiler is aware of the Target Platform for which the code has to be generated
The FrontEnd of the Compiler is involved in Lexing, Parsing and Semantic Analysis. Typically an AST is created during this phase
The BackEnd of the Compiler usually generates the binary code to be executed on the target platform. Several Optimization techniques are used to generate efficient code. 
C Compiler generates object file, which not only has binary code but also has metadata for Linker to facilitate Linking. 
 2. Linker
Linker links the object files into and executable file.  
Object files generated by Compiler have independent Address Spaces.
Linker merges the object files into one Address Space. This process needs Allocation, Reallocation and Resolution of External References.

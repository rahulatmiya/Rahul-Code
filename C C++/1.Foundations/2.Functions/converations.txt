What is a Function Prototype?


StoryTeller

C complier expects that function definition of a given function must precede it's  call. If the condition is not meet the compiler generates error. There are two scenarios when a function call may precede the definition. 

    When Function calling the given function is written above the given function.
    When the given function is in another file. 

To prevent error in both these scenario we write the given function's header above the call site. This function header with an ending semicolon is referred to as a function declaration or function prototype.

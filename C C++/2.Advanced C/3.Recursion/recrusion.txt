Recursion is a property or a characteristic of a system wherein a component of the given system exhibits the property or characteristic of the system.  We refer to such systems as a recursive systems

There are several systems that exhibit this characteristic. The solar system has sun at the center an planets moving around it. Earth a component of solar system has a similar characteristic with Earth itself at center and moon revolving around it. Atom which is the component of earth has nucleus at the center and electrons moving around it. 

Another example being Directory which can have files as its components but it can also have a sub-directory as its component. The sub-directory has all the characteristics of a directory.

In programming parlance if a function calls another function. The callee from execution view perspective is a component of the caller. So if the Caller calls itself the system becomes a recursive system.

In simple terms if a function calls itself the function is said to use recursion.
